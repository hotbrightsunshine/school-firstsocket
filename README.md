# school-firstsocket ğŸ’»

`school-firstsocket` is a project made to understand the basic interaction between a server and a client using Java sockets. 
Client and Server first establish a connection, and then:
- The user is asked to write a message to send to Server;
- Server will modify the message, changing each character to its uppercase corrispondent;
- The user will read the message sent by the Server and print it out in the standard output.
